Visualization is done with D3.\r\n\r\nCorrelation follows the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient\">Pearson algorithm</a>. When visualized, the more blue the less correalted; the more red, the more correlated.\r\n\r\nWe have a general correlation matrix that shows how different similarity algorithms correlates to <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/423\">PMRA applied on stems</a>. Such correlation can be visualized at <a href=\"\"></a>.\r\n\r\nWe also have correlation by topics. We use topics from <a href=\"http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec14/t14_proceedings.html\">TREC-2005 Genomic Track</a>, those are numbered from 100 to 149, excluding 135. such correlations can be visualized at <a href=\"\"></a>. By default topic 100 is shown, in order to change topic add ?topic=101 or any other valid topic number.\r\n\r\nAll of the algortihms used here are for academic purposes. They do not intend to be maintainable or scalable.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
